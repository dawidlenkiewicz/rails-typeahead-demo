# Rails Typeahead Demo

This is some basic searching using the [Twitter typehead](https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/)
library and Rails.

Demo is written based on my [blog post](http://blog.ragnarson.com/2016/01/25/autocomplete-with-typeahead.html).
You can find there more info and details about implementation.

To run it clone the repo, bundle and run

```
rake db:seeds
```

On the index page there is a text input where you can test searching. You can find users inserted from seeds
by their email, github_username or name.
